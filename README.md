You need 3 terminals.
In all three, run 
source install/setup.bash

Then, in any of the three, run
colcon build --package-select robot_controller

(there are a few packages in the repo, this is the only one I care about right now. The other package is the one with MoveIt that I havent really figured out yet)


Terminal 1: (keep this one running b/c its what runs RViz with the correct settings)
ros2 launch robot_controller visualize.launch.py

Terminal 2: (This one just publishes the joint states for RViz and for the main loop)
ros2 run robot_controller joint

Terminal 3: (This one has the main loop. The robots movement will start/stop when you run/exit the code
ros2 run robot_controller run_controller

To change the pick/place locations, go into controller.py and edit the angles defined with pick/place (i made a large line of ### to seperate this part from the rest of the code)

Save the changes, and dont forget to run
colcon build --package-select robot_controller
before you run 
ros2 run robot_controller run_controller

In a fourth terminal, the following command can be run to generate time response plots for each joint:
ros2 run robot_controller plot_joint_data.py
